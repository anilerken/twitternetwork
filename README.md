# twitternetwork

An app that finds the shortest path between two users in Twitter, using a graph. The path is constructed via followers, which means there is an edge from an account to each of its followers. Starting from a given user, the program adds the follower accounts as nodes to the graph and inserts edges from that user to all its followers, and this process is repeated for all followers with Breadth First Traversal, until the target user is found and inserted to the network graph. After that, the shortest path between the starting point and the target user is found and printed. Used networkx for the graph. <br> <br> Unfortunately twitter api has a rate limit and makes the program sleep too many times. Therefore it is very slow. A solution could be scraping, instead of using the api. However twitter's terms of use is against this. <br> <br> For now, there may be bugs and mistakes since I've started it only a few days ago, didn't review it in detail, and also couldn't test very well since twitter makes it too slow. But so far in my tests I didn't see any problems. (Plot of the graph is not beautiful when there are so many nodes but the plot is not the priority for me, only the resulting path is important)
